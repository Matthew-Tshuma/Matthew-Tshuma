# Matthew Tshuma

Aspiring IT Support & SOC analyst with a BSc in Computer Science and hands-on experience building and securing systems. I maintain a home lab of Raspberry Pi servers running Windows and Linux, using tools such as Wireshark, Nmap, tcpdump and Splunk for network monitoring and log analysis. I apply security frameworks (NIST CSF, CIS controls) and data protection standards (GDPR, PCI DSS) when assessing risks and hardening systems.

## Key Projects

- **CarersHub Webapp** – A secure healthcare information management system built as my final-year project. The application helps carers and service providers manage client data, appointments and tasks while ensuring confidentiality and regulatory compliance. Features include role-based access control, secure user authentication, encrypted SQL Server database, audit logging and GDPR compliance. Technologies: .NET C#, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, HTML/CSS/JavaScript. *(Private repository)*
- **Home Lab** – Ongoing personal projects to build and administer a network of Raspberry Pi servers. I configure Windows and Linux VMs, set up firewalls, VPNs and VLANs, and practise incident response using Wireshark, tcpdump, Nmap and Splunk. I write scripts in Python and Bash to automate tasks, and I document findings through risk assessments and controls checklists aligned with NIST CSF.
- **Security Audits & Risk Assessments** – Through my volunteer work with the Scottish Tech Army and personal study I perform full stack security audits. Examples include assessments for "Botium Toys," which covered asset discovery, vulnerability scanning, control assessments, compliance checklists and risk scoring. Reports recommend measures such as multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, encryption and continuous monitoring.
